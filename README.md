# Facebook-Messenger-Chatbot
The project is to build a facebook messenger chatbot. The chatbot returns links to a website (which with it is integrated) according the queries of the user so that user doesn't has to search the entire website to find a thing instead the user could chat with out bot and get direct links to the things which the user wanted.

## LANGUAGE USED
```sh
python3
```
## DEPENDENCIES
```sh
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```
## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
* add new features like knowing name of the sender and reply them using their names.
  this can be done using fb graph api.doing some scraping.
* add better answering.since our motive is to use the bot for our website so the bot would 
  parse the keywords in the query and generate the URL where he wants to go.
* this bot may not just be used for tradional fixed algorithm based answering but we intend
  to add some amount of MACHINE-LEARNING into it.(FUTURE PROSPECT)
